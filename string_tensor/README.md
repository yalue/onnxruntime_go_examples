String Tensor Example
=====================

Working with string tensors is different enough from regular tensors, that they
warrant having their own example.  This one is adapted from a test case in
`onnxruntime_go`.

This example runs `example_strings.onnx`, which is generated by the included
script: `generate_strings_example.py`.

Example Usage
-------------

Run the program with `-help` to see all command-line flags. To run it, you will
need to supply an input string. The program uses onnxruntime's string tensors
to convert the string to uppercase and lowercase.

```bash
./string_tensor -input_string "My string"
```

For example:
```
$ > ./string_tensor -input_string "Hello, World"
Everything ran OK.
Original input: Hello, World
Converted to uppercase: HELLO, WORLD
Converted to lowercase: hello, world
```
